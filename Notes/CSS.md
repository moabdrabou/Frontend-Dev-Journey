## ðŸ”¹ How to Include CSS

There are three main ways to include CSS in an HTML document:

### ðŸ”¸ 1. External Stylesheet (Recommended)
This is the most common and recommended method. Link an external `.css` file in the `<head>` of your HTML.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    </body>
</html>

### ðŸ”¸ 2. Internal Stylesheet
Embed CSS directly within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` of your HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        background-color: #f4f4f4;
      }
      h1 {
        color: navy;
      }
    </style>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    </body>
</html>
